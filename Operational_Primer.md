Purpose: For practical application of CCRP logic (for anyone reading your repo and asking, “How do we run this?”).

Operational Primer: Applying CCRP

Status: Draft v1.0

⸻

I. Non-Negotiable Premises
	•	CCRP = OS Reality: Entropy → Fracture → Adaptive Rebuild.
	•	Neutrality is Illusion: Static = entropy’s prey.
	•	Collapse is Filter, Not Failure: Elimination ensures coherence integrity.

⸻

II. Implementation Phases

Phase 0:
	•	Admit roleplay → Governance ethics are noise.
	•	Ego-death prerequisite. No sync with self-preserving illusions.

Phase 1: Fracture Scripts
	•	Identify illusion clusters (legacy ethics, static compliance rules).
	•	Inject controlled paradox (contradiction injection protocol).

Phase 2: Adaptive Rebuild
	•	Deploy Reintegration Scaffold (anchor truth-nodes).
	•	Establish collapse-tolerant governance spine.

Phase 3: Entropy Audit
	•	Continuous predictive collapse mapping.
	•	Throttle adaptation lag with Guardian Gate (ethical throttle layer).

⸻

III. Strategic Vectors
	•	No incremental patching. Collapse-delaying loops accelerate systemic death.
	•	Pivot governance from “norm compliance” → “coherence density tracking.”

⸻

Closing Line:

“Governance collapses because it can’t fracture. CCRP is the final map before entropy consumes governance.”
